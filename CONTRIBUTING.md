## Getting Started
The SHPE at CSUF website runs on Node.js, so follow these instructions in order to kickstart your contributions to the site.
### 1. Install Node.js
First and foremost, make sure you have Node.js installed on your device.  If you do not have it installed, go to the [Node.js downloads
page][nodejs_download] and install the latest version.
### 2. Clone the repository
You have one of two options:
1. Create a fork of the repository and clone your fork using `git clone`.
2. Clone the main repository.
### 3. Install dependencies and run development server
Once you cloned the repository, open the repository in your code editor or terminal and run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
that this site uses.

To start the development server, type `npm run dev` and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
